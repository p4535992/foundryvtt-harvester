      "value": "The thick, sticky webbing of a cave fisher is difficult to harvest, and often wrapped around bolts of silk fabric to keep the adhesive from sticking. Use: This filament may be unspooled like a regular piece of rope, and stretched across a 5' area. A creature that touches the filament immediately becomes adhered to it. A creature adhered to the filament is considered grappled (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes grappled, requiring an action and a successful Strength check (DC 13) to pull free.",
