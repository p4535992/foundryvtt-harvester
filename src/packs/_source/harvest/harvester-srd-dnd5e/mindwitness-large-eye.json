      "value": "A mindwitness is a telepathic hub or beacon for mind flayers. This link is tied directly to the large eye of the mindwitness, which acts like a signal dish, receiving and transmitting telepathic messages. The large eye can be used by spellcasters, artificers and anyone that studies psionics. Alchemists may be able to mash the eye into a fine paste to create potions and salves.",
