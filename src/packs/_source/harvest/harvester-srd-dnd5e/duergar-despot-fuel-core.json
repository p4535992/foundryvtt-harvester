      "value": "A duergar despot has a powerful cannon fused to one of its arms that shoots a jet of flames at its enemies. Somewhere inside this cannon is a small glass orb filled with swirling red fluid. The core is difficult to find and remove without exploding (when harvesting, if a 5 or less is rolled, the orb explodes and every creature within 10 feet of the must make a DC 12 Dexterity check. On a fail, a creature takes 2d6 fire damage. On success, it takes half). The core is valuable to alchemists and artificers.",
