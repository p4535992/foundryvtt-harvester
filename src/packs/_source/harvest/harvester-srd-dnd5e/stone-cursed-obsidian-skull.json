      "value": "When a stone cursed is created, a fist-sized obsidian skull forms within the torso. A faint echo of the original victim's memory resonates within the skull. A skilled magic-wielder can attempt to extract these memories from it to gain insight into the victim's past or find lore that otherwise would be lost. Use: At the end of a short rest, a character can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to attempt to extract a memory from the skull that is a response to a verbal question posed to the skull by the characters. Once the check is made, whether it succeeds or fails, the skill can't be used in this way again.",
