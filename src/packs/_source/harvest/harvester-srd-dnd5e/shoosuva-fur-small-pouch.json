      "value": "Shoosuva fur is mangy and disease ridden. The fur has a strong odor that makes animals more aggressive and violent. Use: If a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 or less comes within 10 feet of the fur, and can smell it, it must succeed a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become berserk. While berserk, the beast spends each of its turns moving toward the closest creature and attacking it, if possible. The beast remains berserk for 1 minute or until it becomes unconscious. A creature that the beast is normally friendly with can spend an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the effect ends. A beast that has had the effect end, or who succeeds its initial saving throw, is immune to the effect of this item for 24 hours.",
