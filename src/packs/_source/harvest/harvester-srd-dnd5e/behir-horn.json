      "value": "As Behir's were created to fight dragons, their horn magically resonates when a dragon is nearby. Once a behir dies, the power is diminished significantly, but the horn is still effective. Use: The behir's horn will begin to vibrate when it comes within 1 mile of a dragon (whether in its true form or polymorphed), but does not point in any direction. The vibrations become more pronounced as it gets closer to the dragon.",
