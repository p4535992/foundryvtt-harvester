      "value": "A grell has long tentacles that end in a collection of sharp needles. These needles are coated with a paralytic venom which has a numbing effect. Proficiency with the poisoner kit can be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough venom for a single vial. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any venom. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend 12 hour and 100gp worth of material to create Grell Poison (DC 11 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Grell Poison (Contact): Grell Poison is similar to Carrion Crawler Mucus (but with a lower DC check, see DMG p258) A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute (a poisoned creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks). The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This poison usually sells for 200gp, but the poison is often considered an illicit good (and may not be sold to normal vendors).",
