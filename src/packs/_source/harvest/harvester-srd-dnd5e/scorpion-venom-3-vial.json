      "value": "A scorpion have a long tail with a poisonous stinger at the end. It may be difficult to harvest enough venom from the small creature's tail. The venom is a clear fluid with a yellow-green tint. Proficiency with the poisoner kit may be used for harvesting this venom. On a successful check, the character harvests enough venom for a single vial. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison. Refining the Poison: Once the venom is extracted, an alchemist (or someone proficient in the poisoner's kit) can spend an 3 hours and 75gp worth of material to create Scorpion Poison (DC 10 Poisoner Kit or Alchemist Supplies check). Scorpion Poison (Injury): A creature can use a vial of this poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
