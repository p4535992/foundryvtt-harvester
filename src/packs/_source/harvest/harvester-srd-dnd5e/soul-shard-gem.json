Using a gem, a harvester may be able to collect a collect a trace amount of the souls essence, creating a soul shard. A soul shard is highly valued in the magic community. A soul shard is a valuable currency in the Nine Hells. While not as valuable as a full soul, in the Nine Hells a soul shard is worth 10x value of the gem it is embedded in (but less valuable on the material plane).
