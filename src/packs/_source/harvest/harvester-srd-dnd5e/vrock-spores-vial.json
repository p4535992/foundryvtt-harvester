      "value": "A vrock has the ability to release a cloud of toxic spores. These spores can be harvested quickly after a vrock's death. Use: The spores can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or one slashing/piercing weapon. Applying the spores takes 1 action. The coated item is considered magical and any creature successfully hit by this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 1d10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect.",
