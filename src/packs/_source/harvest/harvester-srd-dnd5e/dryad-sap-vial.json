      "value": "A dryads natural skin feels more like the stem of a flower, and their blood is more like thick, sticky orange sap. The sap has a variety of arcane properties that are prized by alchemists, magic users and artificers. Use: The sap can be used to coat 1 medium or smaller creature. Applying the sap takes 1 minute. Once covered with the sap, that creatures skin hardens, similar to the barkskin spell. For the next hour, the target's AC can't be less than 16.
