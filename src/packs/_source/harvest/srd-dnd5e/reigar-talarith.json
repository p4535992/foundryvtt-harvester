      "value": "A talarith (which can be a bracelet, brooch, diadem or necklace) can only be attuned to the reigar that created it, and loses all of its magic when its reigar is killed. In a few hours, it will slowly crumble to dust. However, with a careful ritual, the talarith may be removed from the talarith in tact. With its magic faded, this piece of jewelry is still unique and highly valued.",
