      "value": "A flumph has a gland that secretes a harmless, yet irritating spray, similar to a skunk. The fluid in the gland can be harvested and sold to perfumers and aromatologists, who can change the noxious liquid into a very pleasant perfume. Hunters can use the vial to mark hunting areas, disguise one's own scent, and scare off certain predators. Use: As an action, you may throw the vial of flumph stench up to 20 feet away, shattering it on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the target location must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in the foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for 1d4 hours. The coated creature is poisoned as long as the stench lasts. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.",
