      "value": "The giant strider's fire glands are a bundle of sacs that contain various caustic chemicals. When these chemicals combine and are passed into the throat, it allows the giant strider to spew forth a burst of fire. Alchemists can pull some useful chemicals from these glands. Use: As an action, a creature can throw the bundle of glands up to 20 feet away. Upon impact, the glands explode. Any creature within 10 feet of the explosion must roll a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed roll, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage, and half damage if saved.",
