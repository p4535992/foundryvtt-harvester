      "value": "Sometimes a Brigganock is carrying a wish stone, which are created when a nonmagical wish gets lodged in a stone buried deep in the Feywild. The stone varies in color, but is perfectly smooth, with a soft glow. The stone is touched with fey magic, and valued by spellcasters, elves and certain fey.It is believed that powerful fey can use a wish stone to scry on the maker of the wish, empower a supernatural charm, or provide the spark needed to create an animated object.",
