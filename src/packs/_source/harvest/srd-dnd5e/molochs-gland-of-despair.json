      "value": "Moloch is capable of exhaling a noxious breath of despair, causing a powerful psychic blast, that makes enemies run in fear. This toxic blast is emitted from a glandular sac, that resonates in arcane power, located at the roof of the creature's mouth. Use: As an action, a creature may throw this sac at a point it can see within 30 feet, bursting on impact. All creatures within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or take 3d10 psychic damage and become frightened of the attacker for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.",
