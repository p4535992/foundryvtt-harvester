      "value": "Barghest stomach acid can be used to separate a soul from its body. Requires enchanted vial. Use: If you pour this vial onto a humanoid that has died within the past 10 minutes, that humanoid's soul will begin to be destroyed instead of passing into the afterlife. It takes 24 hours for a soul to be completely destroyed, after which no mortal magic may return that humanoid to life. If a resurrection attempt is made during those 24 hours, the attempt only has a 50 percent chance of success. Removing the acid from the body of the humanoid before the 24 hours is over halts the destruction of the soul. This item has enough stomach acid to destroy one soul.",
