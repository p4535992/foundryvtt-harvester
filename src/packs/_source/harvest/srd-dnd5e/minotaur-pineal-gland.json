      "value": "Minotaur are believed to visualize every route it might take to reach its prey. This ability to coordinate their senses, and possible tie into a psionic \"\"third eye\"\", is a result of the creature's pineal gland. The gland is a small pea-shaped ball of flesh located in the center of the brain. The gland is useful to many researchers (especially those studying demonology or Baphomet).
